## In this program we will use variables
price = 10
## The word (price) is identitfier
price = 20 ## Now this will print price as 20 because it reads line by line

## Number 10 & 20 is an integer, Integers are numbers without decimel

rating = 4.6 ## Now if we have used decimal then it because float

name = 'Abhi' ## Now this is string

is_sold = False ## This is a condition statement which we called boolean

##So we can define four types or variable in py 1. Int 2. Float. 3. String 4.Boolean

print(is_sold)
