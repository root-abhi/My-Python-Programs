email =  'This is Python Class'
print(email[0]) ## This will print first index which would be "T" from This word
print(email[2]) ## This will print "i"


## You can also do Negative Indexing, In Megative Index it starts counting from the end of line. eg:

email = 'This is first email'
print(email[-2]
print(email[-4])
